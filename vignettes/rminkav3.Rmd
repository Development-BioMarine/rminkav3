## About

`rminka` is a wrapper for Minka APIs for accessing the observations.


## Installation

The easiest way to get `rminka` is to install from github repository: 

```{r install, eval = FALSE, echo= TRUE}
devtools::install_github("Development-BioMarine/rminkav3")
```

## Quickstart guide

### Get observations

`get_minka_obs()` This function retrieves observations from Minka. The text or taxon search can be refined by observation date, record quality and location.

> It is recommended to set the `quality` argument to `"research"` in order to get more reliable data that has been validated by several contributors.

#### Fuzzy search

You can search for observations by either common or scientific name. It will search the entire  database, so the search below will return entries that _mention_ seabream fishes , not just seabream observations.


```{r search0, include = TRUE , echo=TRUE}
sard <- get_minka_obs(query = "seabream", year = 2021)

unique(sard$scientific_name)
```


> Note that `get_minka_obs()` will return 500 observations by default. This can be controlled with the `maxresults` argument.

```{r search1, include = TRUE , echo=TRUE}

sard_max_results <- get_minka_obs(query = "seabream", year = 2021, maxresults = 10)

sard_max_results[,1:6]
```


#### Taxon search

To return only records of a specific species or taxonomic group, use the `taxon_name` argument. For example, to return observations of anything from the family Sparidae, and restricting the search to the year 2022: 

```{r search2, include = TRUE , echo=TRUE}

sparidae <- get_minka_obs(taxon_name  = "Sparidae", year = 2022)

# how many unique taxa?

length(unique(sparidae$scientific_name))

#The species are:

unique(sparidae$scientific_name)
```

And to return only the seabream fish observations that also mention the term "banc":


```{r search3, include = TRUE , echo=TRUE}

sard_banc <- get_minka_obs(taxon_name = "Diplodus", query = "banc")

count_sard <- nrow(sard_banc)

count_sard

#the observarions are

sard_banc[1:count_sard,1:2]

```


#### Bounding box search

You can also search within a bounding box by giving a simple set of coordinates.
The set of coordinates are defined by c( min Long, min Lat, max Long, max Lat)
 
```{r search4, include = TRUE , echo=TRUE, fig.cap = "Map of Salpa salpa observations"}

bounds_forum <- c(41.407281, 2.224977, 41.409892, 2.228652 )

diplodus_forum <- get_minka_obs(query = "Diplodus sargus", bounds = bounds_forum, year = 2024, month = 5, maxresults = 7)

diplodus_forum[1,1:6]
```   
and the representation using leaflet is:

```{r leaflet, include = TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.pos='center', fig.cap='Leaflet map with the observations'}


 leaflet() %>%
         addTiles() %>%
         setView(lng = 2.226725, lat = 41.408492, zoom = 16.35) %>%
          addRectangles(lng1 = 2.224977, lat1 =  41.407281,
          lng2 = 2.228652, lat2 = 41.409892) %>%
          addMarkers (
            lng = diplodus_forum$longitude, 
            lat = diplodus_forum$latitude,
            label = paste('Id =', as.character(diplodus_forum$id))
             )
```  

### Other functions

#### Get information and observations by project

You can get all the observations for a project if you know its ID or name as an Minka slug.


```{r search5, include = TRUE , echo=TRUE}

## Just get info about a project
urbamar <- get_minka_obs_project("urbamarbio", type = "info", raw = FALSE)
urbamar$project_observations_count
```


```{r search6, include = TRUE , echo=TRUE, message=TRUE}
## Now get all the observations for that project
urbamar_obs <- get_minka_obs_project("biodiversitat-marina-de-les-platges-de-sant-adria-del-besos", type = "observations")

#Geting the first 5 observations

urbamar_obs[1:5,8:1]
```


#### Get observation details

Detailed information about a specific observation can be retrieved by observation ID. The easiest way to get the ID is from a previous search for that taxon.


```{r search7, include = TRUE , echo=TRUE}
ident <- sard_banc$id[1]

ident

#get_minka_obs_id(ident)[1:4,1:5]
```


#### Get all observations by user

If you just want all the observations by a user you can download all their observations by user ID. A word of warning though, this can be quite large (easily into the 1000's).


```{r picture, include = TRUE , echo=TRUE, fig.cap='Picture of an user observation'}

user_obs <- get_minka_obs_user('ramonservitje')

(user_obs)[1:5,1:3]

#it is possible to view the images with the links in Minka

url <- user_obs$image_url[412]

# Read the image
image <- image_read(url)

# Show the image
print(image)
```
